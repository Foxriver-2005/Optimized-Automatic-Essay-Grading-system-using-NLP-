# Optimized-Automatic-Essay-Grading-system-using-NLP-

## Project Overview

This Project is an automated essay grader that analyzes and provides feedback on an essay's quality by evaluating spelling, grammar, coherence, and statistical structure. Using tkinter, it allows the user to select an essay file (in .txt format) and then reads and processes the content. The script computes key statistics such as word count, sentence count, paragraph count, average sentence length, and sentence length standard deviation. It also checks for misspelled words and provides spelling suggestions, evaluates grammar by scoring individual sentences, and assesses the logical coherence of the essay based on the use of logical connectors. The overall score, derived from the combined results of spelling, grammar, and coherence, is calculated on a 0-5 scale. The script then generates a detailed HTML report that includes the essay's statistical data, spelling and grammar feedback, coherence evaluation, and the full essay content. Finally, the report is saved in a designated folder and automatically opened in the browser for easy viewing. This script is useful for teachers, students, or anyone who wants an automated, in-depth analysis of written content.
